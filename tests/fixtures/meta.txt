These objects were possibly offerings to a deity that was possibly associated with the protection of women and infants during the birthing process. The scene consists of a seated female in labor (the newborn is visible) assisted by another seated female sitting before her who is pulling the baby out of the mother and one seated female who is holding the mother from behind",
