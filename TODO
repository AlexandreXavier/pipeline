TODOs
=====

- the converted model should be wrapped in a zip package, optionally
- serve from media location so apache does the heavy lifting
  or utilize sendfile
- use a cerlery task for offline processing (inluding error handling)
- Management task: Cleanup files after 10 minutes or so. Still 
- fix rate limit code to work on server
- store meta info in redis
- convert deployment to virtualenv on server

Sugar
- uploadable user templates
- package all resources for default templates in zipfile instead of hotlinking
- upload progress bar
- API
- use WTforms to simplify form/error handling
